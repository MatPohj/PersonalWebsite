# Why I Started This Blog

I wanted to create a space where I could document my journey in tech and share what I'm learning along the way. As a student focused on cybersecurity, I believe that writing about topics helps solidify my understanding.

## What to Expect

I'll be posting about:

- Raspberry Pi projects
- Some programming projects I might work on
- Stuff about cybersecurity
